### Processing the data

The `dataset$.getitem()` should return only a list of tensors (e.g. `list(x = x)`).
In "raw" `torch`, it is common to return `id`s and response values as well. `mlr3torch` does not expect these.

Currently, my pipeline is:
- torch dataset to data descriptor
- data descriptor to lazy tensor
- create data.table with response column and lazy tensor column
- use this data.table to create the task
